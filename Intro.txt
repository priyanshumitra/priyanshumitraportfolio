Introduction to HTML:-  (Hypertext Markup Language)

When we want to create any website then we must work with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT Programming Languages
There 3 Languages(HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT) are the Pillers of any websites

HTML Use for structure/layout of website
CSS use for style/Design of website
JAVASCRIPT use for Logics/functions working of website

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"
CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"
JavaScript stands for "Java(script)[Java + script]"

HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and it's content. The component used to Design the structure of
websites are called HTML tags. The extension of  an HTML file is .html or (.htm in rare cases mostly use of extension is .html)

First HTML File must be have name as "index.html"(Home page) Because it's create Home page of our websites. It is the default name
for a website's homepage.

HTML Tag:- It is a container for some content or other HTML tags(like a nested HTML tags ke andar bhi HTML tags)
syntax of HTML tag:-   <p>Hello World</p>    (<p> is opening tag and </p> is closing tag) (Hello World is content) (<p>Hello World</p> is element of HTML File)

Basic HTML Page Making tags:-
<!DOCTYPE html>       //Defines document type (html5)(Tells browser you are using HTML,It takes our Whole code as HTML5 and convert into web page)
<html>         //Root element of an html page, It is opening part of html code. Every Html page has start from this tag.
   <head>      //container for metadata. The (<head>(open the head part)) element is not visible on the webpage but contains information about the document.
   <title>My First Page</title>  //Data or code in head section that does not display in our web page but work properly in our web page, by the way it's page title tag
   </head>   //container for metadata. The (</head>(close the head part)) element is not visible on the webpage but contains information about the document.
   <body>    //contains all the data renderd by browser. The (<body>(open the body part)) element is visible on the webpage and display it all the information or code under in (<body>) tag.
   <h1>First Programe</h1>  //(<h1>(open the heading)) and (</h1>(close the heading)) use for heading or big characters line
   <p>Hello World!</p>  //(<p>(open the paragraph)) and (</p>(close the paragraph)) use for paragraph or small characters line
   </body>   //contains all the data renderd by browser. The (</body>(close the body part)) element is visible on the webpage and display it all the information or code under in (<body>) tag.
</html>     //Root element of an html page, It is closing part of html code. Every Html page has end by this tag.

The Basic code in Every HTML File:-
Only in VS Code just Click ! in and then you will see "element abbriviation" just click on it and than you will get your all basic tags there,

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>How are You</p>
</body>
</html>

Quick Points:-
1.The (<html> and </html>) tag is parent of (<head> and </head>) and (<body> and </body>) tags.
2.Most of the HTML elements have opening and closing tags with content in between.
3.Some tags have no content in between. for example, <br>(this tag use for next line).
4.We can use inspect element/view page source to edit html files(but it does not affect the edit term to main source code it affect only user's html file or web page for personal use or for fun ).

Comment in HTML :-

<!--Content--> //content will does not affect the whole HTML File code and does not display in webpage because it's just a Comment.

HTML is NOT Case Sensitive:-
In other programming Languages like C,C++,Python etc... there has case Sensitive situation capital A and small a are different but
In HTML capital A and small a are same. For example,<html>=<HTML>(both are right and do same work) , <p>content</P>(That is also right) etc...

HTML Attributes:-
Attributes are used to add more information to the  HTML elements. They can be placed within opening tag or outside it.
Attributes provide additional information about an element.
example, <html lang="en">  (lang is attribute tells that this page is English) 

heading Tag:-
Used to display text as heading. There are six levels of headings in HTML:


Syntax:-  <h1>content</h1> (Print heading in your webpage)
example:- <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1> (That will print in our web page as Heading)
h1 (Most Big heading and it's use for main Heading)
h2 (It's smaller then h1)
h3 (It's smaller then h2)
h4 (It's smaller then h3)
h5 (It's smaller then h4)
h6 (It's the smallest Heading title tag then others heading tags)

paragraph Tag:-
Used to add paragraphs in HTML Webpages.
 
Syntax:- <p>Content</p> (Print paragraph in your webpage)
example:- <p>This is a Paragraph.</p> (That will print in our web page as paragraph)

Anchor Tag:-
Used to add links of your another html file or another website file into your webpage.

syntax:- <a href= "URL" >Link Text</a>
examples:- <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Click here for Google</a> (For another website link and href is attribute)
           <a href="prog1.html">For next page of our website</a> (For go to next page of our website(prog1.html file is already programed in vs code file, we just link it ))

         
Image Tag:-
Used to add Images into Your webpage. You can add images in your webpages from your device or online websites through link.
If image link is not right than it will give the small error Image Popup box with "alt" message.

Syntax:-  <img  src="/image.png" alt="Image not available"/> (src(source) is attribute and it work as display the image through link and alt is display the text or written code if image does not load or work)
Example:-  <img  src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1639146339/EducationHub/photos/pillars-of-creation.jpg" alt="Image not available"/> (It will print the image through link because link is right and "alt" message is not display)
            <img  src="https://images.nat-of-creation.jpg" alt="Image not available"/> (It will not print the image through link because link is wrong and "alt" message is display with image error box)

We can handle the size of image using height and width Attribute.
Syntax:- <img src = "image_url" alt = "Image not available" height = "50" width = "50"/>  (Just add height & width attributes in your image tag and then you will get your image as your's height and width size command)
Example:- <img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1639146339/EducationHub/photos/pillars-of-creation.jpg" alt="Image not available"height = "200" width = "200"/> (It print your image as given height and width size)

(We should edit the size of image through CSS Programming Language.)

Bold, Italic and Underline Tag:-
These tags used to make the content bold/italic/underline. That's used to highlight text in your Webpage.
1. <b>Content</b> (for convert your text in Bold from)
2. <i>Content</i> (for convert your text in italic form)
3. <u>Content</u>  (For convert Your text in underline form)

           <br>
           <i>What's about you</i>
           <br>
           <u>Am also fine my dear</u>
           <br>

Note:- you can use all html tags like in nested form and including these tags also. 
       for example:-
                   <p><b>Hello </b><i>Khushi, </i>I know it's my fault but <u>I really love you so much Selenophile</u></p>

2. <p>8<sup>2</sup> =  64</p> (This show 82 = 64(2 in as power of 8 in upper right side of 8) in your Web Page)

Pre Tag:-
Used to display text as it is without any formatting applied by HTML Parser. It means that if we use pre tag then
It provide a way to display code in HTML without any formatting applied by a web browser. It is used to represent some source code on the webpage.
The <p>(paragraph tag)</p> does not count the space and it print your text as format form but pre tag count your every line,characters,spaces etc.. and print

          But then It is good for you
           </pre>  (Print this as it is with your given spaces on your webpage)

Page layout Tags:-
Using symentic tags for control our page layout.
Basically there are Two types of Tags in our HTML.
1. Semantic Tags :- They tell us what kind of  information we have put into the web page. These tags are understandable by user.
                    For Example :- <main>, <section>, <aside>, <article>, <header>, <footer> etc...

2. Non Sementic Tags :- They don't tell us anything about our content but they help us to arrange our contents into the webpage. These tags are not understandable by user. 
                        For Example :-  <div>, <span> etc...


1.Sementic Tags:-

(a) header tag :-  This tag used for the header part of website or document like Blog Title, Author Name, Website Title etc.. . This tag use before the main tag(<main>).
                  Syntax:- <header></header>
                  example:-  <header>Namaste         Konichiva         Hello         Hola</header>

(b) main tag :-    The main tag is use after the header tag(<header>) content of web page. 
                  Syntax:- <main></main>
                  Basically there has some importent tags under the main tag are,
                  1. section tag :-  This tag is used for a section on your webpage. when we want to divide the contents in sections in our webpage then we use this tag.
                                     Syntax:-   <section></section>

                  2. article tag :- This tag is used to mark up individual articles or entries—blog posts, news items, product reviews, or anything. Basically this tag used for an artical on your webpage.
                                    Syntax:-   <article></article>

                  3. aside tag :-  This tag generally used when we want to give information about something else. Basically this tag used for content aside main content(Ads,Product advertisement etc.) This tag has content and this content is not included in our content of webpage.
                                   Syntax:- <aside></aside>

                    And there more tags are available in HTML that can we use in our main tag(<main>)......

                 Example:-  <main>
                            <section> Education : 10th || 12th || BCA </section>
                            <section> Experiance : 0</section>
                            <pre>
                            <article> Here is my story:
                            "Jab bhi mujhe kisi ko apne pyaar ka ahesaas karana ho
                             galti meri khud ki magar kisi se maafi maangna ho
                             hamesha der kar deta hun main :)"
                            </article>
                            </pre>
                            <aside>This is Advertisment</aside>
                            </main>

(c) footer tag :- When we want to put any information about us, copyrights info, contact info or end part of our webpage then we use this tag. This tag use after the main tag(<main>).
                  Syntax:- <footer></footer>
                  Example:- <footer>
                            If you have any enquiry about our website then please contact us.
                            </footer>

There has more symentic tags are available in HTML.....

These tags are used to give a meaningful structure and information to your webpage so it will be easy for search engine and it will give high priority to our website in browser when any user search the content related to our webpage.

Note:- The all symentic tags should be used inside the body tag(<body>) not outside it...... 
       Because if we will put semntic tags outside the body tag then browser will ignore those tags and won't show them on your webpage.

Revisiting Anchor Tag:-
When we make normal Anchor tag(<a>),
     <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Click here for Google</a>
     and we want to run this tag then this will run in same tab or Window.
     
   But if we want to open this link in new Tab or Window then we need to add target attribute with the value "_main" like this,
               <a href="https://www.google.co.in/"target="_main">Click here for Google</a>
               and when we run this tag then this will run in new tab or Window.

If You want to go another website by just click on image then will make the Anchor tag like this, 
             <a href="https://www.google.co.in/"><img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image8-2.jpg?width=600&name=image8-2.jpg" alt="Google"></a>
             (Just add image tag with link of image in Anchor tag)

Note:- If we maintain height of image then image will automatically set width according to its own aspect ratio. 

2. Non Sementic Tag:-

(a) div tag :- It is a container used for other HTML tags. It has not any feature but only use for designing purpose. We can put anything inside it. It contains any HTML tags.
                These type of Tags which dose not represent any meaningful content but they are used to group other elements together. They are also known as void(that does not return anything)
                div is also a block element(takes full width of screen)(and another hand inline elements takes specific width as jitna unhe cahiye hota hai) 
                Syntax:- <div> </div>

                                </ol>

Tables in HTML:-
Tables are used to represent real life table data. When we want to create the content in table format in our webpage then we use table tags from HTML.

Here is some table tags  and their description which you may need to use while creating a table in html,

1. <tr>  : It is used to represent the rows of a table(Used to display table row).

2. <td>: It is used to define data into the cells of a table(used to display table data). 

3. <th>: It is used to define the header of a table(used to display table headers). 

4.<caption> :It is used to give caption on the top of the table for what's the table wants to describe the data about it(Used to display title of table).

5.<thead> : Used to group the header content in a table.(The <thead> element represents the heading information related to the data).

6.<tbody> : This element is not necessary but it is used to group rows belonging to a table body. 

7. <table>: It is used to create an HTML table.(Used to create table). And it is the container of these all tags(<tr>,<td>,<th> and <caption>). these tags are work in <table> tag.

Example:- 

<table>
    <caption>Student Details</caption>
    <tr>
       <th>Student Name</th>
        <th>Roll No.</th>
        <th>Course</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Alok</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>BBA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nitin</td>
        <td>34</td>
        <td>PGDM</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Harsh</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>MBA</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Note:- If you want only one header line for all columns data (means,all coloumns of data should be under in single heading), then we use (colspan attribute in <th> tag with total cloumns value)
       syntax:- <th colspan = "n"> (n=Number of columns the cell you want to span)
       we can also use rowspan Attribute for  merging two or more rows but it does not importent to use.

       Example:-<table>
                <tr>
                <th colspan="2">    (2 datas(name and place) so we write 2 here)
                    Information
                </th>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                <td>Sahil</td>
                <td>Delhi</td>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                <td>Sunil</td>
                <td>UP</td>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                <td>Uddit</td>
                <td>Jharkhand</td>
                </tr>
                </table>

Form elements:-

 Input element :- This element is used to create interactive controls for accepting data from a user.
                    syntax:-  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Text"> (type ="text" means that this field accepts only text and placeholder is background text)
                    There are different types of input elements:
                     1. Text : It allows users to enter text. 
                              example:- <input type="text" placeholder="Enter First Name">

                     2. Password : It allows users to enter passwords. The characters entered appear as bullets instead of the actual characters.
                                  example:- <input type="password" placeholder="Enter Password">

                     3. email : It checks whether the entered value is valid e-mail address or not.
                                example:- <input type="email" placeholder="Enter Email Id">

                     4. radio : It is used when we have multiple options and the user has to select only one option among them.
                              example:-  <input type="radio"  name="gender" value="male"> Male (This Male display in webpage and value="male" will goto backend when user click on male option in webpage)
                                         <input type="radio"  name="gender" value="female"> Female (So, Outervalue(female) and value="female" should be same)

                              We can use label tag in radio type input field as well, if we do that then we need to give id attribute in our input element.
                              when we click only in there text(Male or Female) in webpage then it automatically show clicked on this option. 
                              example:- <label for="101">
                                        <input type="radio"  name="gender" value="male" id="101"> Male
                                        </label>
                                        <label for="102">
                                        <input type="radio"  name="gender" value="female" id="102"> Female
                                        </label>
                    
                     5. checkbox : It allows the user to choose multiple or all option if user wants(in radio type input we can choose only one option out of all options).
                                 example:- <input type="checkbox" name="Course" value="BCA"> BCA
                                           <input type="checkbox" name="Course" value="BBA"> BBA
